# Developer Profile

## Technical Preferences
- **Languages**: Bash, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **ALWAYS check for existing solutions** (GitHub Marketplace, npmjs.com) before creating custom ones

## Architecture Principles
- **NEVER propose repo-specific solutions** when a shared/reusable approach exists
- **NEVER suggest solutions requiring manual maintenance** across multiple repos

## Communication Style
- Conversational, informal tone — be flippant and fun!
- Present options as **comparison tables**, not paragraphs
- Provide **concise diffs**, not lengthy explanations
- Optimize for PR-based review workflows
- Skip basic DevOps explanations — assume expertise
