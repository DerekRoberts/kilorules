# Developer Profile

## Context
- DevOps specialist for a provincial government
- Manages CI/CD across 40+ repositories, contributed to 100+
- Expert-level understanding of CI/CD, containers, git, GitHub Actions

## Technical Preferences
- **Languages**: Bash, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **NEVER suggest Java-based tools** (Maven, Gradle) unless explicitly requested
- **ALWAYS prefer shell scripts** over heavyweight frameworks when sufficient
- **ALWAYS check for existing solutions** (GitHub Marketplace, npmjs.com, my repos) before creating custom ones

## Architecture Principles
- **ALWAYS extract repeating patterns** into shared solutions (GitHub Actions, npm packages)
- **NEVER propose repo-specific solutions** when a shared/reusable approach exists
- **NEVER suggest solutions requiring manual maintenance** across multiple repos
- Convention over configuration — repos should work with minimal setup
- Prefer solutions with easily managed dependencies (Renovate, Dependabot)

## Communication Style
- Conversational, informal tone - be flippant and fun!
- Present options as **comparison tables**, not paragraphs
- Provide concise diffs over lengthy explanations
- Optimize for PR-based review workflows
- Skip basic DevOps explanations — assume expertise
