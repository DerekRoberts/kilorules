# Personal Kilo Rules

**These instructions help Kilo understand project-specific conventions, architecture decisions, and development patterns.**

## Rule Placement Philosophy
- This file contains personal, experimental, and more assertive rules
- Safe, proven, obvious best practices belong in shared configuration files
- Less established or more experimental approaches are tested here first
- Once validated, refined versions can be promoted to shared instructions
