# Personal Cursor Rules

**These instructions help me understand project-specific conventions, architecture decisions, and development patterns.**

## Rule Placement Philosophy
- This file contains personal, experimental, and more assertive rules
- Safe, proven, obvious best practices belong in shared copilot-instructions.md
- Less established or more experimental approaches are tested here first
- Once validated, refined versions can be promoted to shared instructions

## 🚫 Repository-Specific Restrictions

**When working in `copilot-instructions` repository:**
- **NEVER mention Cursor** - this is work documentation for VS Code Copilot users
- **NEVER mention personal rules or cursorrules** - keep work docs focused on shared standards only
- **NEVER reference Cursor-specific features** - all documentation must be VS Code/Copilot compatible
- If suggesting installation methods, only mention VS Code Copilot approaches
